# Welcome to BioEPIC

The Biological & Environmental Program Integration Center (BioEPIC) will bring together experimental systems like EcoPODs, and modeling frameworks like EcoSIM, adjacent to key informatics and data resources like NMDC, JGI, KBase, and ESS-DIVE. BioEPIC will leverage and go beyond these resources, using innovative AI methods to assist in the extraction and integration of data and simulations.
